<h1>Microservices</h1>
<p>In short, the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservice architectural style</a> is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.</p>

<p>A component is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable. A service is a component in a MSA.</p>

<h2>Organized around Business Capabilities.</h2>

<h2>Products not Projects.</h2>

<h2>Smart endpoints and dumb pipes.</h2>

<p>Simple implementations such as <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> or <a href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> don't do much more than provide a reliable asynchronous fabric.</p>
